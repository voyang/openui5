Step 10: Implement “Lazy Loading”

In the previous steps, we have implemented a Resume view that uses tabs to display data. The complete content of the tabs is loaded once, no matter which tab is currently displayed. We can increase the performance of our app by avoiding to load content that is not visible. Therefore, we implement a “lazy loading” feature that only loads the view and data when requested by the user.
