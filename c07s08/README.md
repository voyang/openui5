Step 8: Navigate with Flip Transition

In this step, we want to illustrate how to navigate to a page with a custom transition animation. Both forward and backward navigation will use the “flip” transition but with a different direction. We will create a simple link on the Employee view that triggers a flip navigation to a page that displays the resume data of a certain employee. Pressing the Back button will navigate back to the Employee view with a reversed flip transition.
