Step 21: Data Types

The list of invoices is already looking nice, but what is an invoice without a price assigned? Typically prices are stored in a technical format and with a ' . ' delimiter in the data model. For example, our invoice for pineapples has the calculated price 87.2 without a currency. We are going to use the SAPUI5 data types to format the price properly, with a locale-dependent decimal separator and two digits after the separator.
