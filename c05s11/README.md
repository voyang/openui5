Step 11: Validation Using the Message Manager

So far, we have created a currency field that can format itself correctly. The currency data type also has the ability to validate that user input adheres to to the requirements of a currency; however, data type validation functions are managed by SAPUI5 , which of itself has no mechanism for reporting error messages back to the UI; therefore, we need a mechanism for reporting error messages raised by validation functions back to the user. In this step, we will connect the entire view to a feature known as the "Message Manager". Once this connection is established, any validation error messages generated based on the user input will be passed to the message manager which in turn will connect them to the appropriate view and control that caused the error.
