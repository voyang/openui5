Step 15: Reuse an Existing Route

The Employees table displays employee data. However, the resumes of the employees are not accessible from this view yet. We could create a new route and a new view to visualize the resume again, but we could also simply reuse an existing route to cross-link the resume of a certain employee. In this step, we will add a feature that allows users to directly navigate to the resume of a certain employee. We will reuse the Resume page that we have created in an earlier step. This example illustrates that there can be multiple navigation paths that direct to the same page.
