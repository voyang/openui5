Step 37: Content Density

In this step of our Walkthrough tutorial, we adjust the content density based on the userâ€™s device. SAPUI5 contains different content densities allowing you to display larger controls for touch-enabled devices and a smaller, more compact design for devices that are operated by mouse. In our app, we will detect the device and adjust the density accordingly.
