SAP UI5 & Fiori training with OData on WebIDE (XML Views)


A JavaScript UI library consisting of a feature-rich core and a really large number of UI controls which are organized in a handful of libraries. The end to end Fiori app will be build with XML views and on SAP WebIDE personal edition, All the required knowledge to setup your system is also covered in course.
