Step 38: Accessibility

As the last step in this tutorial, we are going to improve the accessibility of our app.

To achieve this, we will add ARIA attributes. ARIA attributes are used by screen readers to recognize the application structure and to interpret UI elements properly. That way, we can make our app more accessible for users who are limited in their use of computers, for example visually impaired persons. The main goal here is to make our app usable for as many people as we can.

Tip
ARIA is short for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It is a set of attributes that enable us to make apps more accessible by assigning semantic characteristics to certain elements. For more information, see Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) â€“ Part 1: Introduction.
